    "Understanding Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows for the creation of a new class that inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class. This new class, commonly referred to as a child or subclass, can add new attributes and methods or modify existing ones inherited from the parent or base class. This mechanism promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy within the code, making it more organized and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, as a powerful and versatile programming language, supports inheritance, enabling developers to build complex and efficient software systems. Understanding how to effectively use inheritance in Python can significantly enhance your coding practices, facilitating the development of robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the technicalities, let's first understand the rationale behind using inheritance in software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to reuse the code of the base class without having to rewrite it in the subclass. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across different parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: When changes are required, updating the base class automatically reflects in all subclasses, making maintenance easier and reducing the risk of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Inheritance makes it straightforward to extend the functionalities of existing classes. By inheriting from a base class, new classes can add distinct features or modify existing behaviors while keeping the core functionalities intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Organization: It naturally leads to a hierarchical classification of classes, making the architecture of larger software systems easier to understand at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're designing a software system for a vehicle rental service. You might start with a general Vehicle class that includes attributes and methods common to all types of vehicles, such as make, model, year, start(), and stop(). However, different categories of vehicles, like cars, bikes, and trucks, have their unique characteristics and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where inheritance shines. Instead of creating completely separate classes for each type of vehicle from scratch, you can create subclasses like Car, Bike, and Truck that inherit the common functionalities from the Vehicle class and then add or modify features specific to each vehicle type. For example, the Car class might include additional methods like open_trunk()."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "307f632c",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit properties and methods from their parent classes, but what if a subclass needs to modify these methods or call a method in the parent class in addition to performing its own operations? This is where the super() function and method overriding become indispensable tools in the Python developer's arsenal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The super() function is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class. It is commonly used in the initialization of subclasses where you want to use the functionality of the parent class and then extend it. The super() function returns a temporary object of the superclass that allows the subclass to call its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is not only cleaner but also more maintainable, as it ensures that the parent class's initialization code is executed and makes the child class easier to update, especially in the face of changing requirements or class hierarchies."

    "Exercise: Crafting an Employee Inheritance Structure\n",
    "In this exercise, you will demonstrate your understanding of basic class inheritance, method addition, and method overriding by creating a class hierarchy for employees in a company. The exercise will help you grasp how inheritance allows for code reuse and behavior specialization in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: A company has a simple employee structure consisting of general employees and managers. Both types of employees share some common attributes but also have some specific to their role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the Base Class: Create a base class called Employee with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance attributes: name and email.\n",
    "An __init__ method that initializes the name and email attributes.\n",
    "A method called get_info() that prints the employee's name and email in a neat format.\n",
    "Define a Subclass for Managers: Create a subclass called Manager that inherits from Employee. Add the following to the Manager class:\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional attribute called department.\n",
    "An overridden __init__ method that initializes the name, email, and department using the super() function to initialize name and email.\n",
    "An overridden get_info() method that prints the manager's information, including the department.\n",
    "Instantiate and Test Classes: Create instances of both Employee and Manager, and call their get_info() methods to ensure they display the information correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee Name: Alice Smith\n",
    "Employee Email: alice@example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee Name: Bob Johnson\n",
    "Employee Email: bob@example.com\n",
    "Department: Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will allow you to practice designing classes that share common attributes and behaviors while also providing specialized functionality for different types of objects within the class hierarchy. Remember to use the super() function appropriately when initializing subclasses to ensure that inherited attributes are set up correctly."

    "Types of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Inheritance is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming in Python, allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from one or more classes. This fundamental concept not only promotes code reuse but also enables a logical and hierarchical organization of code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Inheritance models the \"is a\" relationship between a child class and its parent class or classes, reflecting real-world relationships and facilitating the implementation of abstract behaviors into concrete actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various types of inheritance, each catering to different programming needs and scenarios. Understanding these types and when to use them can significantly enhance your ability to design robust and scalable software systems. This lecture will guide you through the different types of inheritance supported by Python, providing insight into their functionality and application.\n",

    "Single Inheritance â€“ A child class inherits from one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance â€“ A child class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel Inheritance â€“ A chain of inheritance where a class derives from a child class, which in turn derives from another parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Inheritance â€“ Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid Inheritance â€“ A combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",
